##
# == Manipulates strings like the UNIX Bourne shell
#
# This module manipulates strings according to the word parsing rules
# of the UNIX Bourne shell.
#
# The <tt>shellwords()</tt> function was originally a port of shellwords.pl, but
# modified to conform to {the Shell & Utilities volume of the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016
# Edition}[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html]
#
# === Usage
#
# You can use Shellwords to parse a string into a Bourne shell friendly Array.
#
#   require 'shellwords'
#
#   argv = Shellwords.split('three blind "mice"')
#   argv #=> ["three", "blind", "mice"]
#
# Once you've required Shellwords, you can use the #split alias
# String#shellsplit.
#
#   argv = "see how they run".shellsplit
#   argv #=> ["see", "how", "they", "run"]
#
# They treat quotes as special characters, so an unmatched quote will
# cause an ArgumentError.
#
#   argv = "they all ran after the farmer's wife".shellsplit
#        #=> ArgumentError: Unmatched quote: ...
#
# Shellwords also provides methods that do the opposite.
# Shellwords.escape, or its alias, String#shellescape, escapes
# shell metacharacters in a string for use in a command line.
#
#   filename = "special's.txt"
#
#   system("cat -- #{filename.shellescape}")
#   # runs "cat -- special\\'s.txt"
#
# Note the '--'.  Without it, cat(1) will treat the following argument
# as a command line option if it starts with '-'.  It is guaranteed
# that Shellwords.escape converts a string to a form that a Bourne
# shell will parse back to the original string, but it is the
# programmer's responsibility to make sure that passing an arbitrary
# argument to a command does no harm.
#
# Shellwords also comes with a core extension for Array, Array#shelljoin.
#
#   dir = "Funny GIFs"
#   argv = %W[ls -lta -- #{dir}]
#   system(argv.shelljoin + " | less")
#   # runs "ls -lta -- Funny\\ GIFs | less"
#
# You can use this method to build a complete command line out of an
# array of arguments.
